2.Open the terminal and type the command "python3 filename.py".

Differences between python 2.x and python 3.x:

1.Division operator:
	In python 2.x the division operator gives the result of 	integer division where as in 3.x it gives the result as a 		float.
2.Print function:
	This is the most well known change. In this the print 		function in Python 2.x is replaced by print() function in 		Python 3.x,i.e, to print in Python 3.x an extra pair of 	parenthesis is required.
3.Unicode:
	In Python 2, implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3.x 		implicit str type is Unicode.
4.xrange:
	In Python 3.x, the range function now does what xrange does in 		Python 2.x, so to keep our code portable, we might want to 		stick to using range instead. So Python 3.xâ€™s range function 		is xrange from Python 2.x.
